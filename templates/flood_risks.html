        <p>The risk of flooding is set to surge dramatically due to the rise in frequency and intensity in heavy downpours globally over the past few decades.</p>
        <p>Given the reality of climate change, we should expect the continual rise in global temperatures, with the frequency and intensity expected to grow even further. To mitigate this problem, some proactive measures can be taken by governments and
            organisations and even members of the public.</p>
        <h3>Retrofitting homes</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='retrofitted-home.png') }}">
        <h6>It can be useful to regularly check on your drainage systems, electrical wiring and conduct regular maintenance on your home.</h6>
        <p>This can be seen as an extra precaution to reduce damage and injuries by installing electrical outlets and sockets higher on the wall, waterproofing the house and ensuring the windows and doors have waterproof seals.</p>
        <h3>Permeable pavements, sidewalks or gardens</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='green_spaces.png') }}" , width="400">
        <h6>An example of how greenery can be incorporated into homes</h6>
        <p>Green spaces are seen as a luxury not only to our eyes, but for the world as well. By incorporating sustainable drainage into green spaces i.e. replacing impermeable concrete with permeable materials like grass, rainwater will be drained into
            the soil. This process is known as infiltration and can sustain plant life. By incorporating infiltration, it prevents clogged drainage systems caused by the impermeable concrete resulting in the overflow of water into streets and sidewalks
            and hence, a flood. </p>
        <h3>Land-use planning</h3>
        <p>Government regulations regarding the development of land that reduces flooding and its impacts. This includes prohibiting development, using land in high flood risk areas for open space uses like parks, and mandatory building standards for floodproofing
            to minimise the susceptibility to flood damage.</p>
        <p>There are various ways to manage flood risks, from an organisational to individual level. Most measures are relatively inexpensive and easily implemented. Thus, it is imperative that action is taken to reduce the growing risk of flooding.</p>
